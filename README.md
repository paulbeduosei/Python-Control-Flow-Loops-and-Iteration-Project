# Python-Control-Flow-Loops-and-Iteration-Project

In this project, I practiced fundamental Python programming concepts focused on control flow, loops, and conditional logic — all essential skills for cybersecurity automation, data analysis, and network scripting. 

The tasks revolved around using while loops and if- else statements to solve real-world inspired problems.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of how Python’s iterative structures and conditionals can be applied in practical scenarios — from network connection monitoring and access control to automated data generation. These skills are fundamental to writing scripts that support cybersecurity workflows and IT automation.
